# 
# autosave is the interval in minutes between saves of furnaces.yml
# If set to 0, file will be saved whenever a potential change is detected.
# A value of around 5 minutes is recommended for servers with a larger file.
# 
# fortune_list_mode controls the fortune black/whitelist functionality.
# In blacklist mode, the materials specified cannot be affected by fortune.
# In whitelist mode, only the materials specified can be affected by fortune.
# 
# To disable fortune entirely, set fortune_list_mode: whitelist and fortune_list: []
# You should also remove LOOT_BONUS_BLOCKS from furnace_enchantments.
# 
# disabled_furnace_enchantments controls which enchantments can be gotten from an enchanting table.
# Enchantments obtained prior to changes will still be present and functional.
# 
# furnace_enchantability controls how easily enchantable furnaces are. Defaults to stone equivalent.
# leather/wood: 15, stone: 5, iron armor: 9, iron tools: 14, chain: 12, gold armor: 25, gold tools: 22, diamond: 10
# See http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantment_mechanics#Step_One_-_Applying_modifiers_to_the_enchantment_level
# Setting this value to 0 will NOT make furnaces unenchantable. To disable enchanting entirely, remove the permission
# "enchantedfurnace.enchant.table" or add all enchantments to disabled_furnace_enchantments.
# 
# enchantment_incompatibilities affects which enchantments cannot be recieved when certain others are present.
# On vanilla tools, silk touch and fortune are incompatible.
# This doesn't make too much sense for furnaces given the differences
# in function, but it's enabled by default to match vanilla.
# You do not need to add the reversed mapping of an incompatibility.
# 
# disabled_worlds restores vanilla functionality to the worlds listed.
# Furnaces placed in these worlds will not be remembered and existing saved furnaces will not be loaded.
